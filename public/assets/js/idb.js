// Here, we create a variable db that will store the connected database object when the connection is complete. After that, we create the request variable to act as an event listener for the database. That event listener is created when we open the connection to the database using the indexedDB.open() method.
// As part of the browser's window object, indexedDB is a global variable. Thus, we could say window.indexedDB, but there's no need to. The .open() method we use here takes the following two parameters:
// The name of the IndexedDB database you'd like to create (if it doesn't exist) or connect to (if it does exist). We'll use the name pizza_hunt.
// The version of the database. By default, we start it at 1. This parameter is used to determine whether the database's structure has changed between connections. Think of it as if you were changing the columns of a SQL database.



// this event will emit if the database version changes (nonexistant to version 1, v1 to v2, etc.)
